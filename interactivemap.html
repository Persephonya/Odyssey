            { name: 'Troy – the start of the journey', coordinates: [39.9578, 26.2428], summary: 'After sieging Troy for ten long years, the Greek army won the war and took over the once proud city. After celebrating their victory and dividing the spoils of war among them they could not wait to finally return home again because a decade is a very long time to be so far away from one’s homeland. And home was also the destination of the hero of this story, Odysseus, who was said to be the most cunning and clever of the Greeks and had played a vital role in winning the war. His son Telemachus had been born right before he had to leave for the shores of Troy, so he was eager to see him and his wife Penelope again as soon as possible. So, he and his crew boarded their 12 ships to sail homewards. But little did Odysseus know that the odds were not in his favour, and it would take him another decade to finally return home to his family. ' },
            { name: 'Cicones', coordinates: [40.9988, 26.2295], summary: 'Odysseus’ ships got raided by a group of Cicones, a folk that was on the side of the Trojans during the war. While they lost some men, they still managed to win the fight and escaped. But then they were surprised by a big storm at sea and the ships were veered off course.' },
            { name: 'Island of the Lotus Eaters', coordinates: [38.2100, 14.1310], summary: 'After the storm and being at sea for several days, the ships landed on the island of the lotophages and Odysseus sent scouts to explore the island. The men were welcomed warmly by the so-called lotus-eaters and given sweet lotus fruits to eat. But what they did not know before was that eating lotus had a very specific, bewitching effect and it made them forget all about their task and even their desire to journey home. Instead, they wanted to stay on the island forever. Odysseus, however, realized what had happened in time and dragged the scouts back to the ship.' },
            { name: 'Island of the Cyclopes', coordinates: [37.6964, 15.2489], summary: 'After being at sea again for several days the ships arrived at the island of the Cyclopes which were terrifying giants with only one big eye in the middle of their forehead. Odysseus and some of his men set out to explore the island and came across a cave filled with delicious food. However, soon the giant that the cave belonged to – Polyphemus, a son of the sea god Poseidon – returned home. He was delighted to find some snacks already waiting for him in his cave, immediately ate two of the men and then closed off the entry with a big rock so none of the rest could escape during the night. By the next day Odysseus had already devised an escape plan. He gave Polyphemus some wine to drink and when he was asked for his name Odysseus told him that it was “Nobody”. When Polyphemus fell asleep afterwards, Odysseus rammed a stake into his eye, blinding him completely. Polyphemus woke up immediately and started screaming “Nobody attacked me” and because of this the other Cyclopes thought he had gone insane and ignored him. Finally, Polyphemus removed the stone from the entry of the cave and Odysseus and the men could escape. Finally, back on his ship, Odysseus became arrogant and, full of hubris, he gave the giant his true name who then swore revenge. And so, because he also was the son of Poseidon, Odysseus had made a god his enemy. ' },
            { name: 'Island of Aeolus', coordinates: [39.5029, 19.8946], summary: 'The next stop of the journey was on the island of the wind god Aeolus who welcomed them warmly and hosted them for a month. When they departed again, Aeolus gave Odysseus a leather bag full of wind that would lead them home safely. After that, they travelled fast and easily and soon they could already see the shores of Ithaca on the horizon. However, the men were curious about what was in the bag and sneakily opened it when Odysseus was asleep. The winds escaped and steered the ships back to the point where they had started from. ' },
            { name: 'Laestrygonians', coordinates: [41.3860, 9.1562], summary: 'The next island they arrived on belonged to the Laestrygonians, a tribe of cannibalistic giants. Nearly all their ships except Odysseus’ own got destroyed there but Odysseus and a handful of his men could barely escape with their lives.' },
            { name: 'Aeaea – Island of Circe', coordinates: [41.0209, 9.1130], summary: 'After this, they landed on Aeaea, the island of the mighty sorceress Circe. While she welcomed the scouts that were sent to her with open arms, the food she gave them was enchanted and they all got turned into pigs. Only one of them managed to escape and tell Odysseus about what had happened. On his way to save his men, Odysseus met the God Hermes who gave him an herb that made him immune to Circe’s magic. Circe was charmed by Odysseus and turned his men back to their true form. After this, the men stayed with her for another year before she instructed them to travel to the underworld.' },
            { name: 'Edge of the world,underworld', coordinates: [35.8617, -5.8131], summary: 'They followed her instructions and traversed the ocean to the Western edge of the world, were Odysseus made a sacrifice to the dead. The spirit of the seer Teiresias appeared and told him that he and his crew would be able to return home if they managed to not eat any of the sacred cattle on the island of the God Helios. Failing, however, would mean losing his last ship and all of his men. Several other dead appeared as well, like Odysseus’ mother and his fallen comrades from the war.' },
            { name: 'Back to Circe', coordinates: [41.0209, 9.1130], summary: 'After learning this, Odysseus and his crew returned to Circe’s Island where she prepared them for the rest of the journey and the dangers that were yet to come. ' },
            { name: 'Sirens', coordinates: [38.8385, 15.1934], summary: 'The first of those dangers were the sirens, sea creatures with voices that were so alluring that they could easily lead seafarers into their deaths. Odysseus had used wax to close off his crew’s ears to the sirens’ song and had himself tied to the mast of the ship so he could hear everything but have no way of giving into temptation. Like this, they managed to pass the sirens with ease.' },
            { name: 'Scylla and Charybdis', coordinates: [38.2375, 15.2713], summary: 'The next dangers were Scylla and Charybdis, two terrifying sea monsters that dwelled closely to each other and devoured unsuspecting sailors. While Scylla ate six of the men, the others managed to escape the dangerous situation unharmed.' },
            { name: 'Thrinacia – Island of Helios', coordinates: [37.1592, 14.8919], summary: 'Finally, they landed on Thrinacia, the island that belonged to the Sun-God Helios, as had been prophesized to them. After being detained by a horrible storm and running out of food, the men ignored all prior warnings and hunted the sacred cattle while Odysseus was away. Enraged, Helios punished them for this and all of them, except for Odysseus himself, died in a shipwreck.' },
            { name: 'Ogygia – Island of Calypso', coordinates: [34.9560, 20.7720], summary: 'He was washed ashore on the island of Ogygia where the nymph Calypso resided. He stayed with her for seven years and, in this time, she fell in love with him and didn’t want to let him leave again. But she had to let him go when the Gods, most of all Athena, decided that it was finally time for him to return home.' },
            { name: 'Phaeacians', coordinates: [38.3400, 20.7272], summary: 'His last stop before returning home was the home of the Phaeacians where he got to tell them the whole story of his travels. After this, they provided him with a fast ship to travel home and delivered him safely to Ithaca while he slept. ' },
            { name: 'Return to Ithaca', coordinates: [38.3542, 20.7049], summary: 'Finally, Odysseus got to see the familiar shores of Ithaca again. But the troubles were not over yet because suitors had taken residence in his home and were asking for his wife Penelope’s hand in marriage because everyone thought he had died at sea. Penelope, however, was just as clever as Odysseus and had been stalling for time so she didn’t have to choose any of the suitors. Odysseus got disguised as a beggar by his benefactor Athena and met his son Telemachus with which he devises a plan to get rid of the suitors once and for all. During a shooting contest with a bow, Odysseus and Telemachus killed all of them. After Odysseus managed to convince Penelope that he was actually her husband, the two of them were reunited happily and told each other all about what had happened during the long years they were apart. At long last, the long journey of Odysseus had come to an end.' },
