        <h2>Introduction to the story</h2>

        <p>The Odyssey is undoubtedly one of the most famous and influential stories ever written. It is typically attributed to Homer, who also wrote the Iliad,
            another very popular epos that tells the story of the Trojan war leading up to the journey described in the Odyssey. However, not much is known about Homer, and he was most
            likely not the one who actually wrote those stories but only the first one to write them down.
            The aim of this project is to tell the story of Odysseus' travels in a way that makes it more interactive and thus interesting to younger minds, specifically targeted towards students aged 10-14.
            The Odyssey already has an inherent spatiality to it, and this project is meant to both highlight and use this in an educational as well as entertaining way to introduce
            those young readers to this well-known story.</p>
