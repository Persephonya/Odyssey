                <li><strong>Sirens:</strong> The Sirens were enchanting creatures who lured sailors to their deaths with their irresistible singing.

                <li><strong>Scylla and Charybdis:</strong> Scylla and Charybdis were two mythical sea monsters. Scylla was a fearsome six-headed monster who dwelled in a narrow strait, while Charybdis was a massive whirlpool.
